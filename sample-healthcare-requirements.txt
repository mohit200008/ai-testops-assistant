     * Nurses: Limited access to assigned patients
     * Administrators: System configuration access
     * Patients: View-only access to own records
   - Password complexity requirements: 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols

   - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) < 1 hour
   - Backup encryption using separate keys from production
   - Regular backup restoration testing (monthly)

4. AUDIT TRAIL AND LOGGING
   - All system activities must be logged with timestamps
   - Logs must be tamper-proof and cryptographically signed
   - Log retention: 7 years for FDA compliance
